        <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
        <h3>Car Parks Victoria Application!</h3>

         <h3>Overview of the Car Parks Victoria Application:</h3>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">In essence, my project would be a partnership with the Victorian Governments Public Transport
          Victoria (PTV) Network in Collaboration with their recent ‘Car Parks for Commuters’ Program. It
          would be to create a carpark availability application (App). The application would allow users to
          find their nearest train station that has the option for car-parking; check the times of greatest and
          lowest busyness and see if and how many available car spots there are, ahead of time. This would
          cut-down on travel time for many ‘park-and-ride’ users and would be a completely free platform.

        </p>

           <h3>The motivation behind its creation:</h3>
           <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> I am a first-year university student and I often find myself circling around train station carparks
           waiting for a car spot to become available. This oftentimes adds 20 minutes to half an hour to my
           travel time, and severely frustrates me. I, and many other commuters try to take the train into the
           city because parking in Melbourne’s Central Business District (CBD) can be extremely costly, and
           sometimes even has one-to-two-hour time constraints. This, for myself and many others is not
           helpful as working and studying in the city means needing to be there for hours at a time.
           Currently on the market, there are many parking applications that suit the need of those seeking
           paid parking areas. Making the audience for many of these applications only accessible to those
           that have the funds to pay for short term parking. Being a student and working part-time means, I
           do not have enough money to be able to afford to pay for parking every day of the week; and I am
           sure many others who go about their day in the city are in the same boat.
           Henceforth, I believe having a free application that assists in finding available car spots at train
           stations would making getting into the city more cost effective and less time consuming.
          </p>


           <h3>A description of the functionality of the app:</h3>
           <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> The Application would be available on all platforms. This would include a website, an app for both
           Apple™ and Android making the app easily accessible for anyone on any device. The Interface
           colour palette would match that of the current PTV app; being grey, white and red. However,
           would feature a more modernised and simplistic user interface that appeals to Jakob Nielsen’s 10
           Heuristics. This would ensure both new and experienced users can easily pickup how to use the
           app for easy functionality and ease of use.

         </p>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; color: #24282a;"> The major features of the application would include: </h4>
            <p> <em> Clickable Parking Spot Reservation User Interface (UI): </em> </p>
            <p> This would the give users the ability to enter in a rough time estimate for how long they may be using the parking spot for; this would allow other users to know when spots will become available.
 Further, the application would prompt notifications to users before and when a spot is about to
 become available. The interface design would be similar to that of seating on an aeroplane or
 movie theatre. However, the ‘seats’ would be swapped out for car spots and their car spot number
 which would be located on the floor of the carpark.
 This would need to include onsite technology that sensors when a car is in a car spot, called
 “Vehicle Detection Sensors” (similar to that of a shopping centre). It would also require stations
 where people can enter in the times that they are going to be parked at the station in a “manual”
 sense. This may be particularly useful to get more people to add data to the app without physically
 needing to download it. That data would then get sent to the app and update the app every few
 minutes.
 A problem that may be face with this is users forgetting or not wanting to enter in this data,
 however, to fix that issue it could be made mandatory to enter in before touching on a myki, and
 would even have the option of allowing users to enter in that they are unsure of when they will get
 back to their car spot.

          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: #24282a;"> Other smaller features (however still important):</h3>


          <p> <em> Apple or Google Maps Capabilities with Interchangeability: </em> </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> Apple or Google Maps Capabilities with Interchangeability:
 A ‘map’ interface that can be changed based on the user’s preference with pinpoint locations
 marking the nearest train stations and their carparks. It would be used by allowing the user to
 pinch and scroll (similarly to how they use any maps app) and would see icons of nearby train
 stations.
 This would include the ability to show one’s own location; see the address’ of the car parks of their
 choosing; be redirected to their map app of choice which will then grant them the ability to get
 directions from their location to the end destination and provide an estimate of how long it will
 take to get there and the easiest route.
 Busiest Times Graph:
 This will show the users the peaks and troughs of the busiest
 times and when to best arrive at their preferred car park. It
 would be regularly updated and be based on visits to each
 location. (Similar to the ‘Popular Times’ Graph curated by
 Google inc.)
  </p>

  <div> <img style="width:400px; height: auto;" src="images/Popular Times Google.jpg" alt="popular times"> </div>


  <p> <em>A Menu Bar with easy access to tabs such as a ‘favourite station preference’:</em> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> A favourites section would allow users to pin their favourite station’s carpark and car spot so they
can hastily get updates about the availability of their favourite car spot or location and if it
becomes available.
It would also allow them to easily switch between the maps, the busiest times graph and other
features of the app.

</p>

<p> <em>Car spot reservation option:</em> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> This would allow users to reserve a spot ahead of time for a small, accessible l fee that would be
judged based on how long that individual plans to stay in their car spot. This would be helpful to
users that attend the train station daily for example work commuters that require a spot daily. They
would first choose their end destination (which train station they will be getting off at) and then
have the option to choose if they would like to reserve the spot daily, monthly, or yearly; with the
system estimating prices based on calculations of how long they would like to reserve the spot and
the accessibility of the spot.

<h3>  Tools and Technologies required including software, hardware, open-source material, and
other equipment needed:</h3>
<p>  Software required: Programming Systems for both Apple devices (Swift) and android devices (C++,
Java, JavaScript, and XML). Software such as Atom or Sublime to edit the code. Mock-up software
such as Wireframe to create User-Interface mock-ups. Cloud Services are needed to hold data
obtained by the app from users use. HTML and CSS are required for the creation of a website.</p>
<p> Hardware required: Physical hard drives are required to keep backups of data in case something
happens to cloud services and vice versa. A computer to create and edit code. The possibility of an
Apple, Android, and computer devices for testing.
</p>
<p>Open-source material: Apple iOS requires a native app called XCode, Android requires Android
Studio and is based on Java and XML. Native Script can be used for both iOS and Android.
 </p>

 <h3>Skills required and the feasibility of finding / having these skills:
 </h3>

 <p> The Skills required to create the Carparks Victoria app are as follows:
  </p>
  <p> • A drive to want to create the app, primarily. </p>
<P>  • Proficiency in a multitude of coding languages such as Python, Java, XML, HTML, CSS as a
  strong understandability of each coding software as to debug any issues. </p>
<P>  • Creative ability to develop a user interface that is appealing to the eye yet functionable to the
  highest degree. Thus, an understanding of design skills such as the elements and principles of
  Design, which area easily researchable and able to be applied to designing. Further, an ability to
  use a creative media such as adobe illustrator or photoshop to create the app logo and further
  designs for within the app such as logos and other design elements on the interface. </p>
<P>  • Becoming proficient in coding requires many years of learning and experience and would need
  to be completed by a team, rather than one individual alone. Hence, the ability to work well
  within a team environment is required. Further, using an opensource such as Native Script that
  only requires one to be proficient in JavaScript and may be more helpful for a beginner, such as
  myself.</p>
<P>  • Hardware such as the car detector sensors would need to be installed at all local train station
  that have a carpark, and therefore one would be required to learn how to install and use the
  devices to connect to a network. This network would need a failsafe backup and would also
  require power. </p>


<h3> The outcome and how I hope the app will function if it is successful: </h3>
<p> If successful, the outcome would be a fully functioning carpark app that would make the lives of
daily commuters such as myself a lot easier, faster and more cost effective. It may add an extra
step to the lives of those who catch public transport however, overall, it would save hours each
week trying to find a carpark, use less fuel, saving them more money in the long run. Eventually,
the application would accumulate a variation of different users, and would get smarter with every
increment of data accrued. It may also encourage patrons who regularly drive into work to
reconsider their: parking expenses and how long it takes them to get into the city and, in turn the
applications creation may encourage them to take public transport. Hence, unbeknownst to them,
would be helping the environment.</p>
