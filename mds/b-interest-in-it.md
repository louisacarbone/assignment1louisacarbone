Ideally, I would have my whole life planned by this point, but realistically, I am still working myself
and the world out. I decided to pursue this course on a whim, knowing that I have always been
vehement about all things technology and would love to pursue it in my future.
So, let us take it back to 2009 and beyond…
All-throughout primary school I was elected the 'chosen one' to fix all technical issues within my
classrooms. I paid close attention to my IT teachers, and consistently offered to assist them. For
whatever reason, they also trusted 10-year-old Louisa with the passcode to the IT department.
When I was eight years old, I received my first computer, a HP Pavilion DV6. It was definitely not a
state-of-the-art laptop, but it did the job. Soon after, I was introduced to the world of Minecraft by
my older cousin, and together we ventured through many web-based games together such as
Poptropica and Club Penguin (RIP). I never got into console gaming, because my parents were not
(and still are not) fans of us playing video games. Therefore, my brother and I spent most of our
time at our family friend’s place. There I was slightly introduced to the world of Pokémon, the PSP,
The DSI, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and many other games. However, being the younger
sister, I was strictly the observer and cannot say I have great skill playing any of these games.

Further, in my second year of high school whilst watching a school production, I turned around
mid-performance to what my school called ‘the bio box' and pondered as to why no students were
allowed to help. I questioned if it were possible for me to create a space for myself and my curious,
tech-admiring peers to expand our digital knowledge, and from that point on I founded and
attended a “Tech Club” every Monday at lunchtime. Through the guidance of Anthony George our
schools ‘Audio Visual and Digital Technologies Facilitator’ (Who refused to let us call him “Mr
George”); we learnt how to code a basic website; setup the technical backends of stage
performances; including lighting, sound, and communication; edit photos and videos; created a
podcast room; and due to COVID-19, we adapted to the need of hosting many online assemblies
which required us to setup a “studio” of cameras and microphones within our auditorium.



WHY rmit

RMIT was my first point of call because both my parents undertook their studies here and so too
does my brother, as mentioned. Although, this is not the only reason. It was mainly the accolades
that RMIT has received for its IT courses, along with the scholarships that come with it. It just
seemed to me like an easy decision as it is the closest university to me, and I love being in the city.
For me, a 20-minute train ride was a no brainer over other universities that would take me over an
hour to get to.
I especially loved that in my first semester I was not bound to choosing a major, as I have had little
formal technological education. So, having the ability to grasp the different areas of IT, and being
able to research a future job has been really beneficial for me. I had hoped (and have already
started to) learn the basics of coding, because I have always thought it was a fundamental skill to
have, even just for personal use. I have been thoroughly enjoying making websites; basically, the
hands-on parts of the course that allow you to be creative to a certain degree.
