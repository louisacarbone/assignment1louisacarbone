16 PERSONALITIES TEST RESULT

What the results of the 16 Personality test mean to me:
This test clarified a few things in my mind. One, is that I always wondered why sometimes I can be
the most talkative person in the room and sometimes more inclined to not talk at all. Two, it
explains my behaviour as a child (and sometimes still today) as being the bossy one. Although at
times, it can get the best of me, it excites me because it indicates that I identify as more of a team
leader. I have always found this to be true as whenever I get involved in a task, I always want to
complete it to the fullest and make the most out of the process, and when working in groups,
especially at work, I find myself easily able to guide others within my team whilst being able to
keep up with my own responsibilities.
Moreover, my test results have confirmed my ability to easily judge others’ motives and intent
even before they happen, which is extremely important to me. Especially when working in a group
environment, or even when talking to friends as I do not allow others to overstep any boundaries
or take advantage, because of this upper-hand knowledge.
Further, my test results show that I am inclined to want to help people. This makes sense to me, as
I find that I am the go-to person for many of my friends when they have issues. I have been told
that I am understanding and do not judge right of the bat, and I can connect this to always
ensuring that I get the full story from every perspective before offering any advice or assistance.
How I believe the 16personalities test result may influence my future behaviour in a team:
These test results give me more confidence to stand up within a team and take on as much
leadership as possible. It definitely gives me an end path as to what job I choose in my future.
Which is to take on a role as a leader or manager of groups, because I will more likely thrive in that
scenario. However, for jobs within the near vicinity, it means learning from my leader peers, and
vacuuming as much information on what they do and what may assist me to do better.
How I should take this into account when forming a team:
When forming a team, I will need to consider others’ personality traits too. If there is more than
one leader, like myself I would not mind sharing the guidance and heavy decision making. In fact, I
do not believe it should always be ONE person making all the decision, because that simply may
not represent the views of the whole group. Hence, although I have strong opinions, being
receptive is a quality that I will need to show within a team setting, to make everyone’s opinions
feel valid and will allow the team to come to conclusions easily, although a bit of disagreement is
always helpful in ensuring the best decisions are made.

What the results of the learning style quiz mean to me:
This result confirms a lot. I love singing, and always have from an early age, and hence I have
found when studying, I retain the most information from repeating my notes to myself. Even when
learning material for Italian orals or school plays in the past, I have found I am easily able to recall
big chunks of text quite swiftly. This comes as no surprise to me.
How I think the learning style quiz may influence my behaviour in a team:
I strongly feel that these results would come in handy in a team, because most of a team’s
communication is through speaking and so being able to easily retain a lot of that information is
resourceful, especially when old topics are brought up.
How I would take the learning style quiz into account when forming a team:
I would use it to my advantage, encourage team debates, and regularly discuss processes with my
team along the way, especially if I do not fully comprehend it the first time. Thus, ensuring I am on
the same page as everyone, and everything is clear and concise. I also believe It makes establishing
a team a lot easier, because if everyone knows their preferred learning style it makes it easier to
establish communication and how to teach each other contemporary issues or ideas that may
arise.

What the results of the leadership style quiz mean to me:
This result backups the sixteen personalities result in that I strive and find great enjoyment in being
a leader. These results further indicate that I try to bring out the best in those around me, to help
them reach their potential, in turn also bringing myself greater “self-awareness.” It proves I am
strongly focused on creating a better future for myself and my peers and at the same time
realising that the transformation of society and humanities potential brings great empowerment.
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
Again, I believe they will push me to want to lead the team, whilst still considering myself on a
level playing field to everyone else. In that, I mean I would not consider myself to be above anyone
else and would take on board what everyone has to say. However, I do believe it is important for a
group to have one or more focal guiders that are organised to overarch the whole team.
How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I would take this into account by being extremely considerate of the viewpoints of my team
members and would encourage everyone to get involved and have their say. I hope to uplift
everyone in my group to work to the best of their ability. I would need to find people that have the
same motivation or mindset as myself in that sense, because it is a quality I value.
