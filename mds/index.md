Ciao! Mi chiamo Louisa Carbone or “Hello! My name is Louisa Carbone.” I am of Italian Heritage, with my mother being from Sicily and my dad from Calabria, However I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I am 18 years old, born on the 23rd of October 2003. (Obviously, the number ‘twentythree’ naturally became my favourite and lucky number). I graduated and completed my VCE last year from Siena College in Camberwell.

My sibling experience has been an abnormal one. Growing up I had one older brother, Frank, who also attends RMIT (at the Bundoora campus.) I grew up idolising Frank and copying his every move, which included standing behind him while he played on his computer for hours upon end. Then 13 years into my journey of being the youngest child, my younger brother Adrian was born (I
am still the favourite child). Adrian is currently 5 years old and just started primary school. He is quite cheeky and already knows how to use my mum’s phone better than she does. My parents
are both accountants, so naturally they wanted me to pursue accounting to “keep the family
tradition going.” I tried studying it in VCE and unfortunately, because I did not find the subject that interesting and therefore did not put much time into it, it ended up being my worst scoring
subject… oops (Sorry mum and dad). Nonetheless, it did teach me some valuable lessons about
taxes and other money related life skills.

One fact about myself is that I enjoy singing. Now this does not seem interesting to people until I tell them I auditioned for the voice. What people do not know about The Voice is that there are about 3-4 stages of auditions before you make it to what they call on TV “The Live Auditions”. I was fortunate enough to make it to stage 3, and unfortunate that I did not advance any further. On the contrary, it was a wonderful experience that I may pursue again in my future. Currently, to fulfill my love of music, I *attempt* to write songs when I have the chance; I sing way too frequently in my house and listening to music more than the average listener. I thoroughly enjoy listening to RnB, (some) rap and lo-fi beats. This year, I am (hopefully) excited to attend two concerts around springtime, being Rex Orange County and Tyler, the Creator. My long-term dream would be to join the music industry, eventually. My actual first idea that I wanted to pursue before I started my degree in IT was to study ‘Music Production’ at SAE, however I was looking to do a Bachelor course
and not a Diploma, which was the only thing they offered.


Another fact about myself is that I love collecting clothing from small designers (mostly
sustainable ones). I also particularly love op-shopping for pieces that cannot be found anymore. This is mostly because you will never know what you will find. Some days, you can be extremely successful, whilst other days you may not. With more clothes in this world than we will ever need, I believe its our duty as civilians to prioritise the recycling and or, the reusing of clothing. I rarely ever wear these pieces out, but when I do, I love paring them with basic pieces that I have in my closet.

I also really enjoy collecting shoes; Jordans, Dunks, New Balances and so on. This is a passion of mine that I share closely with my friend group. Recently I won a raffle for a pair of Nike dunk high’s ‘light chocolate’ (shown above). I currently have an ever-growing collection (pictured below). This is a personality trait that I stole from my older brother. But alas, it gives us something to talk about instead of sitting in the car in silence.
