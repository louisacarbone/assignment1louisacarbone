      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h3>Why I chose this course!</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Ideally, I would have my whole life planned by this point, but realistically, I am still working myself and the world out. I decided to pursue this course on a whim, knowing that I have always been vehement about all things technology and would love to pursue it in my future.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> So, let's take it back to 2009 and beyond… </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">All-throughout primary school I was elected the 'chosen one' to fix all technical issues within my classrooms. I paid close attention to my IT teachers, and consistently offered to assist them. For whatever reason, they also trusted 10-year-old Louisa with the passcode to the IT department.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> When I was eight years old, I received my first computer, a HP Pavilion DV6. It was definitely not a state-of-the-art laptop, but it did the job. Soon after, I was introduced to the world of Minecraft by my older cousin, and together we ventured through many web-based games together such as <a style="background-color: #b8cad4; color: blue; padding: 0px; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: blue;" href="https://poptropica.com">Poptropica</a> and Club Penguin (RIP). I never got into console gaming, because my parents were not (and still are not) fans of us playing video games. Therefore, my brother and I spent most of our time at our family friend’s place. There I was slightly introduced to the world of Pokémon, the PSP, the DSI, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and many other games. However, being the younger sister, I was strictly the observer and cannot say I have any particulat skill playing any of these games.
        </p>
            <div class="computer">  <img  style="width:365px; height: 280px;" src="images/hppaviliondv6-3089LA.png" alt="my old hp computer"> </div>

        <P style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Further, in my second year of high school whilst watching a school production, I turned around mid-performance to what my school called ‘the bio box' and pondered as to why no students were allowed to help. I questioned if it were possible for me to create a space for myself and my curious, tech-admiring peers to expand our digital knowledge, and from that point on I founded and attended a “Tech Club” every Monday at lunchtime. Through the guidance of Anthony George our schools ‘Audio Visual and Digital Technologies Facilitator’ (Who refused to let us call him “Mr George”); we learnt how to code a basic website; setup the technical backends of stage performances; including lighting, sound, and communication; edit photos and videos; created a podcast room; and due to COVID-19, we adapted to the need of hosting many online assemblies which required us to setup a “studio” of cameras and microphones within our auditorium.

          <h3> So why RMIT? </h3>
        </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> RMIT was my first point of call because both my parents undertook their studies here and so too does my brother, as mentioned. Although, this is not the only reason. It was mainly the accolades
      that RMIT has received for its IT courses, along with the scholarships that come with it. It just
      seemed to me like an easy decision as it is the closest university to me, and I love being in the city.
      For me, a 20-minute train ride was a no brainer over other universities that would take me over an
      hour to get to.
